📌 Project Overview

This project performs end-to-end data analysis on an online bookstore using MS SQL Server.
It applies advanced SQL techniques—CTEs, window functions, ranking, aggregations, and time-series analysis—to extract meaningful insights that help with sales optimization, customer retention, and inventory management.
